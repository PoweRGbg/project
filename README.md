existing one.
They can access the login and register pages. 

Registered users can view all their meals im "My meals" page. 
They can delete single meal by clicking on the trash can or multiple
meals after selecting them from the tick boxes and confirming their choice.
Also on the right side there is a list of the last five actions done in the
app. Logged in users will also see 2 buttons - "Edit" and "Delete" when 
they enter the details page of every meal they created. These 2 buttons
will allow the creator of the meal to edit its' info or delete it completely.

Every meal can be commented by logged users from the comment box in
